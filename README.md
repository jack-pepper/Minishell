### @Yahya: here we can keep track of what we did and update the README later to explain how we worked

### HISTORY

11/03 [m] init project (create main folders and files)
11/03 [m] try to implement a prompt ([TODO] debug compil error)
19/03 [m] include readline (added both -lreadline -lncurses to Makefile, it *should* work on all systems).
	/!\ I'm working on Linux. Let's check whether there are compatibility issues with MacOS.
          You might have to install readline (brew install readline).


### POSTPONED ISSUES (MUST CHECK BEFORE VALIDATING THE PROJECT)
19/03 [m] make sure readline is correctly included (an installation during compilation may be needed)

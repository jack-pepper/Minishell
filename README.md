# Minishell

## Description
Minishell is a lightweight Unix shell built in C as part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum. It reproduces essential shell functionalities, offering a deeper understanding of how Unix environments manage processes, inputs/outputs, and command interpretation.

Developed with Yahya Elboukili (https://github.com/yahyaeb), this project was designed to prioritize robustness, clarity, and adherence to shell behavior (as much as we could!).

**Technologies Used:**
- C
- UNIX Signals

## Features

- Interactive Prompt: Displays a custom prompt and reads user input with live updates (including signal handling).
- Command Execution: Runs both built-in commands and external binaries.
- Built-in Commands: supports cd, echo, pwd, export, unset, env, exit
- Pipes: handles commands connected via |, including chained pipes with proper file descriptor management.
- Redirections: Input <, Output >, Append >>, Heredoc <<
- Environment Variable Management: includes expansion and dynamic updates to the shell environment, as well as a stash (case VAR=val anterior to the command export)
- Signal Handling: gracefully handles SIGINT, SIGQUIT, EOF, and ensures clean behavior during prompts and execution.
- Error Feedback: Displays context-aware error messages (invalid syntax, missing files, permission errors, etc.)

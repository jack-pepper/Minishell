Minishell

Minishell is a lightweight Unix shell built in C as part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum. It reproduces essential shell functionalities, offering a deeper understanding of how Unix environments manage processes, inputs/outputs, and command interpretation.

Developed by Pepper and Yahya, this project was designed to prioritize robustness, clarity, and adherence to shell behavior â€” all without shortcuts.
